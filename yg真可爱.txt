浅试了一下分支的上传，但是在之后merge时出现了一些奇怪的问题，我已经乱了
E325: ATTENTION
Found a swap file by the name "~/Desktop/gitlearn/BUPTSmartCarLearning/.git/.MERGE_MSG.swp"

      NEWER than swap file!

(1) Another program may be editing the same file.  If this is the case,
    be careful not to end up with two different instances of the same
    file when making changes.  Quit, or continue with caution.
(2) An edit session for this file crashed.
    If this is the case, use ":recover" or "vim -r /c/Users/97329/Desktop/gitlearn/BUPTSmartCarLearnin
g/.git/MERGE_MSG"
    to recover the changes (see ":help recovery").
    If you did this already, delete the swap file "/c/Users/97329/Desktop/gitlearn/BUPTSmartCarLearnin
g/.git/.MERGE_MSG.swp"
    to avoid this message.

Swap file "~/Desktop/gitlearn/BUPTSmartCarLearning/.git/.MERGE_MSG.swp" already exists!
